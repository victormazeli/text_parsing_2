Note - Please run all command from the root of the project.

Dependencies Installation - 

pip install -r requirements.txt


Setup and be able to run the django project you need to add some columns manually,
because the model defined previously was un-managed so columns need to be defined through mysql cli.



Two columns are needed to be added as follows in the Records table- 

subject
duration

SQL commands for the above columns are -

ALTER TABLE Records ADD subject VARCHAR(1024);
ALTER TABLE Records ADD duration FLOAT(20);


SHORTCUT FOR DATABASE SETUP

Create a Database in mysql with name SIC
restore the database dump named - 'databasebackup_sai.sql' in the root of the project and you are good to go


Once the database is updated you need to run 2 programs in the background using the following command in the virtualenv with all dependencies installed - 



python3 detection/Detector.py
python3 websocketserver.py

Please keep the programs running in the background.

Now you need to run the django app - 

python3 manage.py migrate # Optional if migrations are already done no need to run

python3 manage.py runserver


Please note that - 

The real-time data is transmitted from the detector program to the frontend UI using webscoket. 
The websocket server is running on port 9000

An example script "websocketclient.py" is present in the root directory of the folder to test if the websocket is working correctly or not
